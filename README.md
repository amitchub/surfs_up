# Surfs_Up

## Overview
This analysis was commissioned to gather temperature data for June and December.  This data would help inform the decision to possibly open a surf and ice cream shop business year-round.

## Review of Data
Listed below are statistics in bullet-point format for both June and December.  Temperature values are listed in Fahrenheit.

### June

- The average temperature recorded for the data set was 75 degrees F.
- The lowest temperature recorded for the data set was 64 degrees F.
- The highest temperature recorded for the data set was 85 degrees F.

### December

- The average temperature recorded for the data set was 71 degrees F.
- The lowest temperature recorded for the data set was 56 degrees F.
- The highest temperature recorded for the data set was 83 degrees F.

## Summary
The results of the data set illustrate that there is not a significant difference in average or highest temperature between the two months.  There is a more pronounced difference in the lowest temperature recroded.  However, most surfing and consumption of ice cream is conducted during the day; not the night.  So the weather differences, such that they are, should not provide an impediment to opening a surf-and-ice-cream shop.

Two more analyses to conduct that would help to solidify this decision would be the amount of precipitation that each month receives, and the amount of usable daylight that each month receives.  More precipitation yields fewer visitors.  More daylight yields more hours in the day for surfing and ice cream consumption.
